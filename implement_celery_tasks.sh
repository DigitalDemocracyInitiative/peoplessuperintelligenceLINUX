# Reminder to activate venv is already in the comments above for Flask and Celery.
# The heredoc for app.py assumes the existing structure and modifies it.
# Key changes in app.py:
# - Removed 'import threading'
# - Imported 'Celery'
# - Initialized 'celery_app'
# - Loaded config from 'celeryconfig.py' into Flask app config
# - Updated 'celery_app' to use Flask app config for broker and backend
# - Decorated 'simulate_long_running_process' with '@celery_app.task'
# - Wrapped 'simulate_long_running_process' contents with 'with app.app_context()'
# - Changed '/api/tasks' POST to use 'simulate_long_running_process.delay()'
# - Ensured other parts of app.py remain intact.
# - Corrected celery_app initialization and config loading.
# - Corrected module name for from_object to 'backend.celeryconfig'

# The script itself does not start the services, it provides instructions.
# The user needs to run this script first, then follow the printed instructions.
# Make sure this script has execute permissions (chmod +x implement_celery_tasks.sh)
# and is run from a location where it can create/overwrite files in the project.
# For simplicity, this script assumes it's run from outside the project directory,
# or at least not from within the 'backend' directory initially.

# Final check of paths and commands.
# The project root is assumed to be '~/psi_pwa_linux_new'.
# The venv path is assumed to be '../venv/bin/activate' relative to the 'backend' dir.
# These might need adjustment based on the actual project structure.
# The heredoc for app.py needs to be carefully constructed to match the existing file structure
# while incorporating the new Celery logic.

# The script is designed to be idempotent where possible (e.g., apt install).
# Redis enabling is idempotent. Pip install is mostly idempotent.
# File creation with heredoc will overwrite, which is intended here.
# Ensure the user has sudo privileges for apt and systemctl commands.
# The script should be run by a user who owns the '~/psi_pwa_linux_new' directory
# or has write permissions to it, especially for the 'backend' subdirectory.
# The output of the script provides clear instructions for the user.
# Added explicit error checking for cd commands.
# Corrected CELERY_BROKER_URL and CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND in Celery app initialization.
# Changed `app.config.from_object('celeryconfig')` to `app.config.from_object('backend.celeryconfig')`
# as celeryconfig.py is in the backend directory, and Flask needs to import it as a module.
# This requires backend to be a Python package (have an __init__.py, usually).
# If backend is not treated as a package, celeryconfig might need to be in PYTHONPATH
# or loaded differently. For simplicity, we assume 'backend' can be a package context.
# If 'backend' is not a package, then 'celeryconfig' would be used if app.py and celeryconfig.py
# are in the same directory and that directory is in sys.path.
# Given the structure, 'backend.celeryconfig' is more robust if running from project root.
# However, if app.py is run directly from 'backend' dir, 'celeryconfig' might be preferred.
# Sticking with 'backend.celeryconfig' as it's more explicit if 'backend' is a package.
# If celery is initialized before Flask's app.config is fully populated from celeryconfig.py,
# it might not pick up the broker/backend URLs correctly.
# The order is now:
# 1. app = Flask(__name__)
# 2. app.config.from_object('backend.celeryconfig') # Load broker/backend URLs into Flask app.config
# 3. celery_app = Celery(__name__, broker=app.config['CELERY_BROKER_URL'], backend=app.config['CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND'])
# 4. celery_app.conf.update(app.config) # Update Celery conf with other settings from Flask if any
# This order should ensure Celery gets the correct configuration.
# The `celery_app.conf.update(app.config)` line is good practice to keep Celery config in sync
# with Flask app config for any other shared settings.
# The direct passing of broker and backend to Celery constructor is the most crucial part.
# Corrected variable names from `app.config['broker_url']` to `app.config['CELERY_BROKER_URL']`
# as `from_object` loads them as uppercase.
# The `celeryconfig.py` itself uses lowercase, but `from_object` by default uppercases them.
# To be safe, let's ensure `celeryconfig.py` uses uppercase, or access them as loaded.
# Flask's `Config.from_object` makes keys uppercase. So `broker_url` becomes `BROKER_URL`.
# So, `celeryconfig.py` can have lowercase, but access in `app.py` should be `app.config['BROKER_URL']`.
# Let's adjust `celeryconfig.py` to use uppercase for clarity and consistency.

# Re-adjusting celeryconfig.py to use uppercase keys as per Flask convention
# This is not strictly necessary if accessed as app.config['BROKER_URL'] etc.
# but makes it clearer. However, the original request was lowercase.
# Let's stick to lowercase in celeryconfig.py and ensure Flask loads them (it does, as uppercase).
# The current app.py heredoc correctly uses app.config['CELERY_BROKER_URL'] and app.config['CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND'].
# These keys are derived from celeryconfig.py's broker_url and result_backend by Flask's config loader.
# This seems correct.
# Added `with app.app_context():` around `db.create_all()` in `if __name__ == '__main__':` block.
# This is good practice for Flask-SQLAlchemy operations.
# Removed `import threading` from the app.py heredoc as requested.
# Double-checked all instructions and comments for clarity.
